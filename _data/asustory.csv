This initial student body included 16-year-old students with no high school education, since there were no high schools in the Arizona Territory. Farmer's early efforts were spent establishing the school's core curriculum. He wanted students to be well grounded in the basics of reading, writing, spelling, grammar, arithmetic, geography, and United States history. Students also took classes in philosophy, Latin, rhetoric, English literature, and the philosophy of education. Farmer gave out diplomas to only 5 students in his three semesters as teacher-principal to students of varying ages and experiences - not because of a lack of students, but because he would reward no student who failed to satisfy his academic standards. In his view, unprepared teachers would be of no value to the communities nor to the students they served. Principal Farmer is credited with establishing the Territorial Normal School's first practice teaching program, and he put his advanced students to work teaching the lower classes.

In 1925 the Bulldogs had their first out-of-state game against the Texas School of Mines. The team won its first Border Conference Championship in 1931. A new stadium named in honor of Garfield Goodwin opened in 1936 with a seating capacity of 4000. The team worked its way toward their first Sun Bowl invitation and victory at El Paso in 1940. Following World War II, the team was renamed the Arizona State College Sun Devils by a student vote in 1946. With support from the Sun Angel Foundation, founded in 1946, the team began its climb to notoriety by playing in two Phoenix Salad Bowls, benefit games for underprivileged children, in 1950 and 1951. To support a growing interest in ASU football, Sun Devil Stadium was opened in 1958 with a seating capacity of 42,000 people. During the 1960's the Sun Devils dominated the Western Athletic Conference, ending the decade with a 1970 Peach Bowl victory in Atlanta. The Sun Devils' success continued through the 1970s, earning invitations to seven Fiesta Bowls and culminating with their move to the Pacific Athletic Conference (Pac-10) in 1978. Arizona State's greatest gridiron triumph, since beating the University of Arizona in their first game in 1899, was their 1987 Rose Bowl victory over the University of Michigan. The Devils are still the only Arizona team to earn a Rose Bowl invitation. Since 1940 the Maroon and Gold have competed in 17 bowl games with a record of 10-6-1.

Of the 158 students enrolled in 1896, 61, or 40%, were men, none of whom had played football. That didn't stop them from learning the game and participating in the sport. Physical education for women was soon added to the curriculum under Principal McNaughton, which brought the Normal School into the limelight. But the game of football became more than just a sport under McNaughton. In fact, the football rivalry between Tempe and Tucson began under McNaughton's era with the first ""Big Game"" in November, 1899. ASU won the first football contest with the University of Arizona 11-2 at Carillo Gardens Field in Tucson. The Normal School also won the championship of the Football League of Arizona in 1899.

Of the 18 buildings constructed under his tenure, six are still in use. Matthews' legacy of an ""evergreen campus"" with the importation of many shrubs and trees, including the planting of Palm Walk, continues today with the establishment of ASU Arboretum. Matthews also saw to it that the Tempe Normal School of Arizona was an accredited institution outside the state. He served on numerous national educational boards, bringing recognition to the campus and its faculty.

He challenged both students and faculty to set high academic standards for themselves, believing that ""good thinking today is best preparation for tomorrow."" Swetman was instrumental in the development of a strong teacher training program at the college. He felt that an education should be affordable to all students in the state, and attempted to make the college a student-centered institution.

Many of the veterans who had received military training in Arizona decided to stay in the state and vowed to return after the war. The numbers within one year were staggering: in the fall semester of 1945, 553 students were enrolled; over the weekend semester break in January 1946 enrollment increased 110% to 1,163 students. Successive semesters saw continuing increased enrollment. In addition to the enrollment increases, President Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings on the campus and attracted substantial federal funding for construction. His greatest dream of a great auditorium was envisioned with his friend Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed what is now the university's hallmark building, Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium. Construction of Gammage Auditorium was completed in 1964, five years after Gammage's death. President Gammage's greatest achievement was his commitment and work in guiding Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe through the academic changes and physical growth that justified attainment of university status in 1958.",ASU Library:,/objects/small/13lead_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/13lead_th.jpg

Although his administration was marked by disharmony with the athletic department, he worked to make athletics a source of pride for the university. One of Nelson's goals was to make ASU a multi-campus institution. He met this goal with the establishment of ASU West in 1983, which brought education to western Maricopa County. Student enrollment also increased from 37,000 to 40,500 students under Nelson's tenure. Nelson brought a new focus to computer-assisted learning and research within the university, and provided computer literacy training for the community. In the Spring of 1988, ASU completed its most successful fund-raising campaign to date, surpassing its original $75 million goal.

Coor, Jr., a native Arizonan, became 15th in the institution's succession of principals and presidents. In his inaugural address he highlighted undergraduate education, research, cultural diversity, and economic development as the ""four pillars"" of the university's agenda. Dr. Coor has taken major steps in these areas by further defining the role of ASU West and by initiating the establishment of ASU East. During his tenure, ASU was named a Research I university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in early 1994. This high status has enabled the university to achieve major support for research projects and for educating future scientists. President Coor shaped the university into an academic powerhouse and realized his vision for ASU as a world-class research university comprising excellent students, faculty, and staff. President Coor's impact is reflected by the enthusiasm with which the alumni, community, and state have supported the university's Campaign for Leadership - the largest fund-raising effort in state history. Total gifts have exceeded $400 million. President Coor's vision for the next 10 years is of an Arizona State University more highly regarded in traditional measures with the capacity to adapt to change quickly. ""We can't predict what the world will look like,"" he said. ""What we can do is be poised to move as the demand moves. We will have a much more fully developed organizational capacity to deal with change."" It is clear that Arizona State University, under the leadership, guidance and administration of President Lattie F. Coor, Jr., is on the move, and the sky is the limit.

30athlet,,image/jpeg,image,objects/30athlet.jpg,"1977 ASU Team, Track and Field National Champions","Jump to Article Below 1977 ASU Team, Track and Field National Champions 1970s UP UPC ASUA T83 1970s There was a time when Arizona State was a huge force in track and field, culminating in a team championship in 1977. After a brief slump, the team has rebuilt a solid core and is reentering the national picture. If the calendar year 1999 was any indication, the new millennium will mark the beginning of a golden era in track and field at Arizona State. Greg Kraft, ASU's eighth director of track and field and cross country, has tirelessly rebuilt a program from probation to prosperity as he's in his fourth year as a Sun Devil. Last year saw the Sun Devils record their best NCAA Outdoor Championship men's finish since 1983, their best NCAA Indoor Championship men's finish ever, their best NCAA Indoor Championship women's finish since 1995, and their best NCAA Cross Country Championship finishes for both men and women ever. Twelve Sun Devils earned All-American honors in 12 different events. Nine individual school records, four team records and one individual collegiate record were broken. In the Pac-10, ASU had its best men's track finish since 1992. The year 2000 should be even more productive than the previous three years, which saw nine individual track & field All-Americans, three All-American relay squads, three cross country All-Americans, five Pac-10 individual titles, two individual NCAA runner-up finishes, 17 first or second-team Pac-10 All-Academic selections, two Academic All-American cross country squads, and the first three NCAA appearances by a cross country team in ASU history. After spending his first two years at ASU rebuilding the program one event at a time, building a foundation that focused on recruiting the high school ranks, 1999 saw Kraft get some results. During the indoor season, ASU's men finished 11th and the women in a tie for 32nd at the NCAA Championships. Marcus Brunson (60 meters) and Dwight Phillips (long jump) were NCAA runners-up and Brunson had broken the collegiate record in the 60 meters earlier in the year. Six indoor school records were broken. The outdoor season saw three school records fall while the men finished fifth in the Pac-10, just 0.5 point out of fourth place, and 18th at the NCAA Championships. Phillips captured both the long jump and triple jump Pac-10 titles and Fiona Daly recorded her second straight women's high jump conference crown. ""When I look at our program from where we were 3.5 years ago, I feel like we're on schedule,"" Kraft said. ""I felt like it would take us three recruiting classes to get competitive. Competitive in my mind is to be in the upper division of the Pac-10 and in the top 20 nationally, which I think we are. Obviously our goal, and the stated goal of the department, is to annually compete for top-three Pac-10 finishes and top-10 national finishes. I think our men are at that point right now. ""When I look at the program's total health,"" he continued, ""even though I really like our team and we'll contend for some really good honors this year, we don't have the distribution of aid I'd like to have. If we have 12 scholarships, I'd like to have three in my freshman class, three in my sophomore class and so on. If you look at our aid, our distance aid might be heavy in the freshman class, our sprint group might be heavy in the junior class; we need to have a program where annually we're at nationals contending for titles in the relays. We need to have a program where every year we're competing for a national berth in the cross country championships. If we have those kind of athletes in place, then it's very reasonable for us to be a top-three, top-10 team. To do that, you have to have a really mature program. Right now, I think we are talented, but I don't think we are a mature program. But, obviously, we're a lot closer than we have been in recent history."" Consider the numbers one through 332. One is the number of NCAA Team championships the program has earned, coming in 1977. Fifteen is the number of top-10 placings the teams have earned in outdoor and indoor national championships. And don't forget 32, the number of individual or relay national champions this program has produced. ASU's Hall of Fame includes 19 track and field Sun Devils. There are 33 Olympians that have donned maroon and gold, 10 of which earned medals, including seven gold medal winners. All-America honors were awarded to 63 indoor athletes and 181 outdoor contenders. Over the years, ASU has boasted 332 conference champions. The list of ASU alumni is long and prestigious. Heading this list is ASU senior associate athletic director Herman Frazier, who is one of the most well-recognized athletes to represent ASU athletics. He earned gold (4x400m relay) and bronze (400m) medals at the 1976 Olympic Games and was selected to the 1980 U.S. Olympic squad. He captured a pair of NCAA individual events while leading the team to its only NCAA title in 1977. Maicel Malone is one of the most gifted sprinters in Sun Devil annals as a 10 time All-American and six time national champion. She earned a gold medal as part of the 1996 4x400 Olympic relay team and is training for the 2000 Games. Lynda Tolbert earned four national titles while a Sun Devil, earning eight All-America honors. Leslie Deniz became the first U.S. woman to win an Olympic medal in the women's discus when she earned silver at the 1984 Games. She also won the 1983 NCAA discus title and broke the U.S. record five times in a two-year span. Ulis Williams ranked among the world's premier sprinters in the 1960s, running on the world record-setting mile relay at ASU in 1963 before earning an Olympic gold medal in the 4x400m relay one year later. He also boasts two NCAA crowns in the quarter mile. There are a variety of reasons why so many runners have had, and continue to have success while training in the ASU area. Tempe and the surrounding Valley offer consistently ideal weather for fall, winter and spring training. The nearby parks, canal systems and greenbelt provide a variety of terrains and an abundance of soft surfaces on which to train. With the addition of a brand new track and field facility, and acres upon acres of grass fields on campus, every training requirement can be met. With a strong and experienced administrative commitment to the track and field program, tremendous weather, great training areas, and a tradition-rich history, it's easy to see why Arizona State is one of the nation's best. -- ASU's Sports Information Department",Campus Lives - Athletes,/objects/small/30athlet_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/30athlet_th.jpg

After World War II, the bell became a trophy awarded to the winner of the ASU and U of A football game. It was also sounded for athletic victories. Finally, when Senator Carl Hayden donated a piece of sandstone from the original White House, the bell was installed on this pedestal and given a place of honor on the west patio of the Memorial Union. The bell was removed some time in the 1970s when the Memorial Union was remodeled. Its current location is unknown.

He returned to ASC in 1947 to head the Alumni Association and serve as director of Special Projects. Creasman was also the driving force behind the final name change to ASU. Katherine Klink Gammage arrived at ASC as the wife of President Gammage in 1950. As a college president's wife, she was very supportive of the school, and particularly of the Name Change in 1958. Her contribution to the ASU community continued after the death of President Gammage, and included taking responsibility for gifts and grants to ASU as a forerunner of the Development Office. In addition, she founded the Friends of Music, the History Associates, the ASU Foundation, the Friends of Channel 8, and the ASU Library Associates.
