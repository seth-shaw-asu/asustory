Acknowledgements
================

"Many individuals and campus offices have generously contributed their
time and documentary resources to this project, but a few individuals
have made contributions far beyond the call of duty. In particular I'd
like to offer my greatest appreciation to **Rose Minetti** of Archives
and Manuscripts and **Heather Knowles** of Library Instruction, Systems
and Technology, who effectively collaborated on this excellent blend of
historical content and technological wizardry. **Sue McNamara** of
Archives and Manuscripts assisted on many aspects of the project. **Drew
Henschen**, student employee of Library Instruction, Systems and
Technology, scanned most of the images and manipulated the text. **Dean
Sherrie Schmidt** of University Libraries has consistently supported
University Archives' dreams and aspirations. **Tim Trumble** of Media
Relations and **Mark Brand** of Intercollegiate Athletics shared
important documentary content with us. Many others have reviewed exhibit
text and presentations and offered positive and useful feedback. Thanks
to all of our collaborators for making this lasting tribute to the
history and culture of Arizona State University."
