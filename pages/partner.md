The *New* ASU Story: Community, Collaboration and Partnership
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Territorial Normal School was established in Tempe because the
community recognized the potential of having an educational institution
in their city. Today the university offers cultural and economic
opportunities to the entire state through its graduates, facilities and
talented faculty and staff. Community outreach, national partnerships
and international collaborations are essential functions of an urban
research university.
