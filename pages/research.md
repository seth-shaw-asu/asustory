The *New* ASU Story: Research
=============================

Basic and applied research preceded attainment of university status in
1958, but establishment of seven new colleges, construction of Hayden
Library and conferring of the first doctorates in the 1960s enabled 30
years of research program development. This progress was recognized when
ASU was named a Research I university by the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching in 1994.
