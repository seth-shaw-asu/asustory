The *New* ASU Story: Leadership
-------------------------------

In just over a century, sixteen principals and presidents have led ASU
on its journey to greatness. Working together with student government,
the academic senate, staff council and alumni our leadership has created
a university of distinction with a commitment to quality education.

## <a id="STUDENT">Student Government</a>

The Tempe Normal Student Association was organized in 1910 to lift
"school spirit" by organizing the student body. Their accomplishments
included the homecoming parade, traffic control at athletic
competitions, and supervision of assemblies. In 1931 the constitution
was changed; the association was now formed by the president and two
representatives of each class. Their goal was to make the Sahuaro a
student-body publication and they also made provisions for traffic
regulations on the campus "speed-ways." In the late 1930s the student
government responsibilities included budgeting of funds to student
functions. Today, Associated Students of Arizona State University
(ASASU) represents 50,000 registered students.

## <a id="ALUMNI">Alumni Association</a>

The Alumni Association was established in 1894. Its purpose was listed
in the 1895 catalog as follows:

> "It is confidently believed that all graduates of this school will
> manifest a lively interest in its welfare. Their influence on the
> schools of the territory is already plainly seen and it will doubtless
> increase as they increase in experience and numbers. The Faculty desire
> to be informed of the success of the graduates and also to render them
> professional assistance as far as possible."

The Alumni Association serves the alumni and unites the members for the
purpose of advancing Arizona State University.

The Classified Staff Council serves as a liaison between the classified
staff and administration. There are records of members as early as 1967.

## <a id="SENATE">Academic Senate</a>

In 1949 the Faculty Council, later Assembly, was formed which gave
administration and faculty equal voice on matters of instruction. The
organization now supports the development of academic professionals and
faculty at ASU. The name was changed to Academic Senate in 1991, to
better reflects the membership that includes academic professionals.

## <a id="OTHER">Other Leaders</a>

Listed below are individuals not mentioned elsewhere who made
significant contributions in laying the foundation of ASU. Most worked
at ASU countless years during the most difficult times: through wars;
through growth periods; at times with little staff and funding. These
are only a few examples of the many men and women who made a
difference.
