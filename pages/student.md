The *New* ASU Story: Student Organizations
==========================================

Student organizations reflect the personalities and goals of the
individuals participating, as well as the social climate of their times.
Early organizations focused on academic concerns and social activities.
These groups were the seed for the many organizations, clubs and
societies that continue to flourish on campus today.
